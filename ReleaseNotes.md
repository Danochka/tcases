# Release Notes #

## 1.4.0 ##

  * Introducing [Output Annotations](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/Tcases-Guide.htm#annotations): For an output transformation to produce concrete test cases, sometimes the basic information in the input model is not enough. You need to add extra information that is not important for generating the test cases but is necessary to form the final output. That's what output annotations are for.

  * JUnit output: To assist completion of test case code, Tcases now adds comments listing all input variable values in the Given section of each @Test method body. But if you prefer the previous output format, you can exclude these comments using the command line option `-p values=false`.
  
  * See [Troubleshooting FAQs](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/Tcases-Guide.htm#trouble) for more help on what to do when things go wrong. This includes more info on how to control Tcases logging output, including how to redirect logging to standard output. Also, logging messages have been improved to make it easier to understand what's going on.

  * Reducer: For better performance, reduce test cases for each function independently

## 1.3.1 ##

  * To better support embedding in other apps, add stream-based methods for generating ([Tcases.getTests](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/api/org/cornutum/tcases/Tcases.html)) and exporting ([Tcases.writeTests](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/api/org/cornutum/tcases/Tcases.html)) test case definitions.

## 1.3.0 ##

  * The **once** attribute applies only to a default 1-tuple for a single variable. But now there is now a more general way to define once-only exceptions to higher-order combinations, by adding [Once elements](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/Tcases-Guide.htm#once-tuples) to your generator definition.

  * Tcases Maven Plugin: Use parameter=project to more easily select a single project.

## 1.2.2 ##

  * Tcases Guide: Rework to avoid inadvertent substitution of Maven properties.

## 1.2.1 ##

  * Reducer: Improvements to logging make it easier to track progress.

## 1.2.0 ##

  * Introducing the [Tcases Reducer](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/Tcases-Guide.htm#reduce), which helps automate the search for a smaller set of test cases.

## 1.1.1 ##

  * For XML input files, Tcases now validates the attributes specified for all elements. Tcases reports an error if any attribute is unknown or invalid.

## 1.1.0 ##

  * Restructured as Maven project containing multiple modules, all downloadable from the Maven Central repository. See [HowToDownload](HowToDownload.md).

  * Now available as a [Maven plugin](http://www.cornutum.org/tcases/docs/tcases-maven-plugin/), so you can use Maven to generate test cases directly from the system input definitions for your Maven project.

## 1.0.1 ##

  * If generating JUnit (using the -J option), use a more useful default output file name of the form **${projectName}Test.java**. If necessary, convert the **${projectName}** part of the file name into a valid Java identifier. Consequently, -J does not have to be accompanied by -f to get good results.

  * When reading a system input definition document, report a failure for any reference to an undefined property. Write a WARN log message for any property definition that is not actually used.
